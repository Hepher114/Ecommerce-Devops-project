This project is a demo e-commerce application built to simulate a real-world production system. The application sells astronomy-related products such as telescopes and accessories, similar to large-scale platforms like Amazon or Flipkart.

The system is designed using a microservices architecture, where each service is responsible for a specific business function. These services include shopping, product catalog, product details, cart management, currency conversion, shipping, and product recommendations. Each microservice runs independently, reflecting how modern e-commerce platforms are developed and maintained by multiple teams.

From a DevOps perspective, this project focuses on deploying and managing a complete end-to-end application composed of multiple services. It provides hands-on experience with real-world DevOps workflows such as service deployment, inter-service communication, and infrastructure management.

This project is forked and adapted from the OpenTelemetry Demo (Astronomy Shop) project. The original repository provides a microservices-based e-commerce system designed to demonstrate OpenTelemetry instrumentation and observability in a near real-world environment.
