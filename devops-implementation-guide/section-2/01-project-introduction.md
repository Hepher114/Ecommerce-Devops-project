## **Real-World DevOps with a Multi-Microservice E-Commerce Project**  


Through this hands-on project, I gained invaluable practical experience in real-time DevOps implementation using a highly popular **E-Commerce demo project** open-sourced by **OpenTelemetry**. I discovered that this project is widely recognized as one of the best real-world applications for learning DevOps, and I personally found it offered the most practical insights I could have asked for.  

What made my learning experience even more immersive was working with a **multi-microservice architecture**, where each microservice was developed in different programming languages. This helped me **understand and tackle real-world challenges** that I now know arise when working with diverse tech stacks in production environments.  

### **What I Learned Throughout This Project:**  
**Cloud Infrastructure Setup** – I learned how to configure and deploy a cloud environment for DevOps implementation.  
**Understanding the Project & SDLC** – I gained in-depth knowledge of software development lifecycles in microservices-based architectures.  
**Containerization with Docker** – I learned how to package and manage applications efficiently using Docker.  
**Docker Compose Setup** – I mastered managing multi-container applications with Docker Compose.  
**Kubernetes for Orchestration** – I learned to deploy and manage containers at scale using Kubernetes.  
**Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform** – I discovered how to automate and manage cloud infrastructure effortlessly.  
**Resume & Interview Preparation** – I learned how to add this project to my resume and how to confidently present it in job interviews.  

By completing this project, I now have **end-to-end experience in implementing DevOps for a real-world application**, which has made me job-ready and confident in handling DevOps challenges in any professional environment.
